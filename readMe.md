# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a full-stack web application designed to manage employee information. It consists of a backend API developed in Spring Boot and a frontend user interface built with React.

## Features

- **Get All Employees:** Retrieve a list of all employees in the system.
- **Create Employee:** Add a new employee to the database.
- **Get Employee by ID:** Fetch detailed information about a specific employee by their ID.
- **Update Employee by ID:** Modify the information of an existing employee.
- **Delete Employee by ID:** Remove an employee from the system based on their ID.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** The backend is implemented in Java using the Spring Boot framework. It provides RESTful APIs for managing employee data. Employee details are stored in a database.
- **Frontend:** The user interface is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive and dynamic web applications.
